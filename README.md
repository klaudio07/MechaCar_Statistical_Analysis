-  In the summary output, each Pr(>|t|) value represents the probability that each coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model. According to our results, ground clearance and mpg (as well as intercept) are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. When an intercept is statistically significant, it means there are other variables and factors that contribute to the variation in quarter-mile time that have not been included in our model. These variables may or may not be within our dataset and may still need to be collected or observed.

From our linear regression model, the r-squared value is 0.68, which means that roughly 68% of all predictions will be correct when using this linear model. 

In addition, the p-value of our linear regression analysis is p-value: 6.712e-11, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.

Using our visualization in combination with our calculated p-value and r-squared value, we have determined that there is a significant relationship between ground_clearance and mpg.

R-squared:  0.7119,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.6791 suggest a strong correlation and the P-value significantly lower than 0.05, suggest strong correlation and prediction as expalined in more detail in Deliverable 1.
